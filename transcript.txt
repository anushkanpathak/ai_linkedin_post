Sahiti is exploring careers in Product Management, Product Marketing, and Tech Consulting. She has a development background and strong interest in owning product vision and lifecycle. She understands PM responsibilities—customer needs, feature development, collaboration, and go-to-market. She needs to improve in customer insight tools (VOC, FGD), analytics, cost/financial acumen, and strategy. Recommended skills include stakeholder management, Excel/PowerPoint, product lifecycle knowledge, communication, and technical understanding. She’s advised to do live projects, electives in analytics, corporate finance, and strategy. Tech consulting roles involve systems integration, SAP, and stakeholder alignment. Case competitions build skills but don’t guarantee roles. “Case in Point” book is suggested.
